# contains helper code to randomly generate a field

# let's make a function that takes, perhaps,
# a number of walls, field dimensions, and minimum wall length
# and creates a list of points that represent vertices of adjacent walls
# that satisfy MASLab field specs


# let's also make a function that makes a list of walls
# given the output of the above function
